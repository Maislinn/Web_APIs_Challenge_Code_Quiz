## Description
```text
As apart of UC Berkeley's course, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

I have learned from thsi project, that it is important to plan out your file structure before beginning, this was an early assignment that did not have a plan yet, and was therefore needing to be rebuilt.
